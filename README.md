- This project is an analysis of datasets of countries' yearly GDP and inflation rate, between 2011 - 2021

-In this project, we analyze more than 200 countries to identify the top five countries with the highest total GDP over a 10-year period. We examine the GDP and inflation rates of each country to determine their investment potential. By identifying these countries, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors looking to allocate their resources strategically.
