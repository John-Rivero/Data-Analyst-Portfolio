## [1. Top 5 Countries with the Best Investment Potential: An Analysis of GDP and Inflation Rates in SQL and Visualization in Tableau](https://github.com/John-Rivero/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/1.%20Countries'%20Yearly%20GDP%20Analysis)
- This project is an analysis of datasets of countries' yearly GDP and inflation rate, between 2011 - 2021

- This project uses SQL queries to analyze datasets and identify the top 5 countries with the best 10-year GDP and inflation rate for investment purposes.

- Use Tableau to visualize the top 5 countries with the best 10-year GDP and inflation rates for easy comparison and identification of investment opportunities.

## [2. The Impact of GDP on Fertility Rate: A Quantitative Analysis of National Wealth and Population Growth in R and Visualization in Tableau](https://github.com/John-Rivero/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/2.%20Economic%20Growth%20vs%20Fertility%20Rate)
- This project is an analysis of datasets of countries' yearly GDP and fertility rate, between 2010 - 2020

- In this project, R is employed to examine datasets and determine whether a correlation exists between GDP and fertility rate.

- Use Tableau to visualize whether a correlation exists between GDP and fertility rate.
